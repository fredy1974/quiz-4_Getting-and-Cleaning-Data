#1 Unzip the data file: 

'features.txt': List of all features

'activity_labels.txt': List of class labels and their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'train/subject_train.txt': ID's of subjects in the training data

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

'test/subject_test.txt': ID's of subjects in the training data

#2 Run the codes in run_analysis.R script that merges data from all the raw data txt files to produce a tidy data txt file

Consequently the appropriate "activity_id"'s and "subject_id"'s are appended to the "test" and the "training" data, which are then combined into one single data frame

Using the "grep" function, all the columns with mean() and std() values are extracted and then a new data frame, including only the "activity_id", the "subject_id" and the mean() and std() columns, is created

Using the "select" function, descriptive activity names are merged with the mean/std values dataset, to get one dataset with descriptive activity names

'group' function is being used to find the average value for each of the variables and each subject

Whereas, two data files are created, 'Final_data_1' which contains the tidy data with the mean/std along with their descriptive activities

While the other file 'Final_data_1' contains the average of each variable for each activity and for each subject

Both the final files are created by 'write.table' function
